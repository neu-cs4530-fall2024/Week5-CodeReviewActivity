# Week 5 Code Review Activity

In this activity, you will all be reviewing a pull request that the course
staff has written to add a feature to the calculator project. We haven't
written any code in a long time, though, so our skills are kind of rusty...
maybe you can help us out.

## Important notes to read before doing anything

- When reviewing our code, you _must_ click "Start a review". This way, you can
  write many comments and then publish them all in one go at the end.
- You _must not_ publish the review until we give the go-ahead. Everybody
  should publish at the same time to avoid influencing one another.

## The task

Write a review of our proposed change to the calculator. When writing your
review, you should:

- Aim to push the project forward with your commentary
- Find and suggest fixes for bugs
- Find and suggest fixes for minor code architecture problems
- Advocate for best practices as you have learned them in this course
- Be clear, direct, and kind

You should not:

- Gatekeep development of the project
- Be rude or hostile
- Assume our code is correct just because we are the course staff
- Assume your comment or question is insignificant

Have fun.
